        <h4> About Rosa Parks </h4>
        
        <p><i> Who is Rosa Parks?</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rosa Parks’ mother was a teacher and her father was a carpenter. Her ancestry included African, Scots-Irish, and Native American.</li>

She was elected as a secretary and organized “The Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor.” It is known by the Chicago Defender as “the strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.”</li>

        <h4> Why is Rosa Parks Important? </h4>

        <p><i> Why is Rosa Parks Important in American History?</i></p>
        <p>Tired from a long day at work she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man on 1 December 1955. Her refusal that day started a huge agitation against the unequal ways in which African–Americans were treated and which came to be known as the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, religion or national origin. It also stated that all schools would be open to African–American children and that they would no longer have to attend separate schools specially set up for them.</p>

        <h4> About Inequality </h4>
        
        <p><i> What is Inequality?</i></p>
        <p>There are wide varieties of economic inequality, most notably measured using the distribution of income and the distribution of wealth. Besides economic inequality between countries or states, there are important types of economic inequality between different groups of people.</p>

        <p><i> When Did Rosa Parks Face Any Inequalties and How Did She Cope With Them?</i></p>
        <p>Inside a bus on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a soft-spoken African-American seamstress, refused to give up her seat to a white man, breaking existing segregation laws. The flawless character and quiet strength she exhibited successfully ignited action in others.</p>

        <h4> How To Prevent Inequality </h4>

        <p><i> What Would I Do, If I was in The Same Shoes as Rosa Parks'</i></p>
        <p>If I was in the place of Rosa Parks then I would have done the same thing as the inequality was too much during that time and I would have liked to face up to that inequality. We should protest against inequality because everyone in the world are same and thus should be treated the same. We can take many steps to stop inequality even if they are small steps. These small steps can make a big change in the future.  </p>

                <h2>Why I took This Topic?</h2>
                <h3>
                I took this topic because in some places I have faced inequalities myself and thus Rosa Parks story was very relatable to mine. I also wanted people to know more about inequalities and Rosa Parks.
